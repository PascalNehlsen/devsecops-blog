# Starting My DevSecOps Journey

Every great journey begins with a single step. Mine started when I realized that building applications isn't just about functionality—it's about building them **securely from day one**.

## Why DevSecOps?

As a full-stack developer working with Python, Django, and modern frontend frameworks, I encountered my first major security incident. A misconfigured API endpoint exposed sensitive user data. That moment changed everything.

I realized:
- **Security can't be an afterthought**
- Developers need to own security
- Automation is key to consistent security practices

## The Learning Path

### Phase 1: Security Fundamentals
I started with the basics:
- OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
- Secure coding practices
- Authentication & authorization concepts
- Cryptography fundamentals

### Phase 2: Tools and Technologies
Next came the practical tools:
- SAST: SonarQube, Bandit, ESLint security plugins
- DAST: OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite
- SCA: Snyk, Dependabot, Safety
- Secrets Management: HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager

### Phase 3: CI CD Integration
The real power came from automation:
- Integrating security scans into GitLab CI/CD
- Implementing security gates in pipelines
- Automated vulnerability reporting
- Container scanning with Trivy and Clair

## Key Takeaways

1. **Start Small**: You don't need to master everything at once
2. **Practice Daily**: Set up a home lab, break things, fix them
3. **Community Matters**: Join security communities, attend meetups
4. **Document Everything**: Your future self will thank you

## What's Next?

In upcoming posts, I'll dive deeper into:
- Setting up your first security pipeline
- Common vulnerabilities in Python/Django applications
- Container security best practices
- Kubernetes security hardening

The journey is just beginning, and I'm excited to share what I learn along the way.
