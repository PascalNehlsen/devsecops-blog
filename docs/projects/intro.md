# Projects Intro

Welcome to my DevSecOps portfolio! On this page, you'll find an overview of my latest projects in the DevSecOps space. From integrating security practices into CI/CD pipelines to automating compliance and monitoring, I focus on building secure, scalable, and efficient solutions that blend development, security, and operations. Explore my work to see how I apply DevSecOps principles to enhance software delivery while maintaining a strong security posture.

## Featured Projects

- **VM Setup** [(GitHub)](https://github.com/PascalNehlsen/v-server-setup) [(Docs)](vm-setup/overview):  
  This project demonstrates how to configure an existing server with **nginx**, generate and use **SSH keys** for secure login, disable password-based authentication, use **aliases** for SSH connections, and manage multiple **SSH identities**.

- **Baby Tools Shop** [(GitHub)](https://github.com/PascalNehlsen/baby-tools-shop) [(Docs)](baby-tools-shop/overview):  
  This project contains a **Django** application designed for managing a baby tools e-commerce store. The project uses **Docker** to containerize the application and deploy it to a virtual machine (VM).

- **Python Tools** [(GitHub)](https://github.com/PascalNehlsen/dso-python-tasks/tree/main/module-5/) [(Docs Folder)](python-tools/overview):  
  This project contains the source code for my own implementation of the **hashcat** tool. Hashcat is a powerful password recovery tool that uses brute-force or dictionary attacks to crack hashed passwords by leveraging the processing power of CPUs, GPUs, or other hardware.
