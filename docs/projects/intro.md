# Projects Intro

Welcome to my DevSecOps portfolio! On this page, you'll find an overview of my latest projects in the DevSecOps space. From integrating security practices into CI/CD pipelines to automating compliance and monitoring, I focus on building secure, scalable, and efficient solutions that blend development, security, and operations. Explore my work to see how I apply DevSecOps principles to enhance software delivery while maintaining a strong security posture.
