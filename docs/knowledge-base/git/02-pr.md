# Pull Requests

A **pull request (PR)** is a feature in Git-based version control systems (like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket) that allows developers to propose changes to a codebase. It facilitates code review and collaboration before merging changes into the main branch.

## Key Concepts

- **Purpose**: Pull requests are used to discuss and review changes before integrating them into the main codebase.
- **Branching**: Typically, changes are made in a separate branch, and a pull request is created to merge this branch into the main branch.

## Creating a Pull Request

1. **Make Changes**:

   - Create a new branch and make your changes.

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature-branch
   ```

2. **Commit Changes**:

   - Stage and commit your changes.

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add new feature"
   ```

3. **Push Changes**:

   - Push the branch to the remote repository.

   ```bash
   git push origin feature-branch
   ```

4. **Push Changes**:
   - Go to the repository on GitHub (or your chosen platform) and open a new pull request from your branch to the main branch.

## Reviewing Pull Requests

- **Comments** Team members can review the changes and leave comments or suggestions.
- **Approvals**: Once the changes are reviewed, team members can approve the pull request.
- **Merging:**After approval, the pull request can be merged into the main branch.
